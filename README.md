# Rainfall-Prediction-using-ML


This project applies machine learning techniques to predict rainfall, providing critical support for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. Using data from 1901 to 2015, this system explores various models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees, to predict rainfall intensity with high accuracy.

*Key Features:*
- *Data Preprocessing*: Handles data cleaning, feature extraction, and exploratory analysis.
- *Modeling*: Implements and compares models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Ridge Regression.
- *Accuracy*: Achieves up to 93% accuracy, aiding in decisions around crop planning and flood management.
- *Future Enhancements*: Suggestions for integrating deep learning architectures, improving real-time data updates, and leveraging remote sensing data.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance rainfall forecasting accuracy, benefiting resource allocation and strategic planning in agriculture and beyond.
